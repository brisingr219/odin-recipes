# odin-recipes
Project for a programming bootcamp I am working through.
This is going to be a compilation of recipes I may typically make on a day to day basis.
Hopefully, by the end of this project I will have demonstrated at least a beginner level of knowledge as far as developing a website is concerned. 
I will program an HTML based website using the skills and lessons I have learned over the last two weeks. 
Things such as creating an HTML boilerplate, creating proper commit messages, using correct syntax to achieve functioning code as concisely as possible, inserting functioning hyperlinks (that are secure), and most importantly code that can be understood by anyone. Which it should be, because I still don't really know what the hell I'm doing.
