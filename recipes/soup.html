        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Baked potato soup is a dish that we typically make here at my 
        house on those chilly Autumn nights. It is a simple and cost-effective 
        way to make a filling meal that is guaranteed to be loved by all. </p>

            <ul>

                <li>3 1/2 Cups Chicken Broth</li>
                <li>2 Cups Half and Half</li>
                <li>1/4 Cup of Sour Cream</li>
                <li>1/2 Teaspoon of Black Pepper</li>
                <li>2 Cups of Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
                <li>1 Bundle of Fresh Chives</li>
                <li>Onion Powder</li>
                <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by washing and peeling your potatoes, then cut them into 
                    one inch sized cubes.</li>
                <li>Put the cut potatoes into a brazier and fill it with water so 
                    that it just covers the potatoes, then start heating that up to 
                    a boil.</li>
                <li>Now take your bacon and slice them into cubes about a half inch 
                    wide</li>
                <li>Dice your onion and mince your garlic and set them to the side 
                    for now</li>
                <li>Your chives need to be finely diced, you'll want small pieces 
                    for your garnish.</li>
                <li>While your potatoes are boiling we'll take a large frying pan 
                    and start cooking the bacon. 
                <em>Note: please observe SAFE food handling procedures, always 
                        wash your hands after touching raw meats and clean any 
                        surfaces you may place them on thoroughly to prevent any 
                        cross contamination.</em></li>
                <li> When your bacon is dark and crisp transfer it to either a 
                    plate lines with paper towels or a draining rack . This is 
                    to let the grease from the bacon drain a bit so they aren't 
                    sopping wet.</li>
                <li>Now take two tablespoons of the bacon grease in the pan and 
                    set them in a small bowl or cup to the side. We'll be using 
                    this later.</li>
                <li>While we're waiting for the potatoes to finish boiling lets 
                    grab another pot, I use a stock pot, and let add a little bit 
                    of cooking oil and the bacon grease we saved to the bottom so 
                    we can start sauteing our onions and garlic.</li>
                <li>On a medium-medium high heat let the onions cook down until 
                    they are nice and soft before adding your garlic.</li>
                <li>When your veg are cooked to a sufficient degree you'll want 
                    to toss your butter into the pot with them. Once this is 
                    mostly melted down reduce your heat to a medium-low. </li>
                <li>Check your potatoes, you want a fork to pierce the potato 
                    easily, but not so easy that it splits apart without much 
                    force.</li>
                <li>After your butter is melted fully we are going to slowly 
                    add our flour. Using a silicone whisk or spatula mix your 
                    flour slowly into the butter and vegetables. If done 
                    properly this will leave you with a paste-like mixture. 
                    This is vital for thickening the soup in the next step.</li>
                <li>Now we will add the chicken broth while mixing slowly. 
                    Once finished you will slowly add your half and half 
                    while stirring the soup. Be careful you don't dump it 
                    all in at once, be patient and take it slow.</li>
                <li>Once your potatoes have reached the desired tenderness, 
                    remove from heat and strain the potatoes. Once done 
                    transfer them to a large mixing bowl and lightly mash 
                    them. You want large chunks of potato for the soup but 
                    softened so it all mixes well.</li>
                <li>One done mashing add the potatoes to the soup and stir 
                    well to homogenize the potatoes with the soup.</li>
                <li>Now we will add the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, 
                    and black pepper to the soup to taste. </li>
                <li>Once finished mixing bring everything up to a boil and 
                    reduce to a low heat. Once lowered we are going to mix 
                    in our cheese.</li>
                <li>After that is complete you're ready to serve!</li>
                <li>Scoop the soup into a bowl and then sprinkle some of the 
                    bacon and chives over top. Feel free to add a dollop of 
                    sour cream and some extra cheese if you'd like.</li>
                <li>Now dig in!</li>
