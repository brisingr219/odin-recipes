        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Broke Man's Ramen is a recipe I came up with on a chilly winter night
          when I didn't have much time or energy or money to make a "proper" dish. It is a simple,
          but delicious, take on dressing up instant ramen to make it more filling
          <em>and</em> more palatable. Can easily feed a family of five!
