        golden potatos around the right side and above the steak. There are fresh herbs 
        and garlic sitting directly on the steak. Oil can be seen on the bottom of the pan
        and a fresh sprig of thyme is laying over top of the asparagus and the steak."

        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This dish is one typically saved in my household for a special occasion. It does 
            not tend to be the kindest on your checkbook, but when completed it is <em>well</em> worth 
            the money you spend for the ingredients. It is a pan seared New York strip steak,
            served with oven baked asparagus, and air fried baby golden potatoes. I have found
            that learning how to make this dish properly really strengthens and builds on a lot 
            of the foundations and skills you learn when you're first starting out on your cooking
            journey. Enough yammering from me though. Let's get to it!
