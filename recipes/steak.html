        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This dish is one typically saved in my household for a special occasion. It does 
            not tend to be the kindest on your checkbook, but when completed it is <em>well</em> worth 
            the money you spend for the ingredients. It is a pan seared New York strip steak,
            served with oven baked asparagus, and air fried baby golden potatoes. I have found
            that learning how to make this dish properly really strengthens and builds on a lot 
            of the foundations and skills you learn when you're first starting out on your cooking
            journey, and developing new ones that will increase your skill. Please keep in mind this is 
            not a beginner's dish. It is going to be tough, it is going to test your patience, but at
            the end of it all you will have grown as a cook! Enough yammering from me though. Let's get to it!

                <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>Four Cloves of Garlic (per steak)</li>
                <li>Onion Powder</li>
                <li>Garlic Powder</li>
                <li>Dried Oregano</li>
                <li>Dried Basil</li>
                <li>Dried Rosemary</li>
                <li>Cajun Seasoning (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We'll start by preheating our oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. This is for the asparagus</li>
                <li>I use an air fryer for my potatoes. My settings are 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 
                    20 minutes, shaking the potatoes around at the 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let's also get out a pan to cook our steak in. The best kind is one big enough to fit the 
                    steak comfortably, while leaving about an inch and a half of room on all sides. This ensures 
                    you don't overcrowd the pan, and leave well enough room to baste the steaks later.</li>
                <li>Now let's prep the separate parts of the dish!</li>
                <li>For the asparagus you'll want to make sure you clean them and then break the ends off at 
                    their natural points. <em>Note: This can be done by grabbing either end of the asparagus 
                    and bending it until it breaks on it's own</em></li>
                <li>For the potatoes we are going to quarter them. They should be fairly small, and you'll cut 
                    them in half once and then in half once more.</li>
                <li>For the steaks you'll want to make sure that after they are defrosted you let them rest at 
                    room temp for at least 10-15 minutes before you apply any of the seasonings. This is a pretty 
                    good time to pat the steaks dry with a paper towel, removing any of the moisture build up from 
                    the defrosting process. Let's get to seasoning!
                    <em>Note: please observe SAFE food handling procedures, always wash your hands after touching raw 
                    meats and clean any surfaces you may place them on thoroughly to prevent any cross contamination.</em></li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl toss your quartered potatoes. Over top we'll add a thin layer of fresh 
                    cracked salt, a  thin layer of fresh cracked pepper, oregano, basil, rosemary, onion powder, and 
                    garlic powder.</li>
                <li>Now toss the potatoes kind of like a salad. This is to spread and mix the seasonings and oil so 
                    they cover all the potato sections evenly. Taste your mixture afterwards If you feel that there's 
                    ever not enough of a certain seasoning add more. However, you'll want to do this very carefully. 
                    Seasonings can be added easily, but overseasoning is a real possibility and can be tricky to undo.</li>
                <li>After your potatoes are seasoned we'll transfer them to the baskets of the air fryer. Mine has 
                    two 5 quart baskets so it makes cooking large batches at the same time fairly easy. <em>(Ninja 
                    for the win! lol)</em></li>
                <li>Next, in the same bowl as the potatoes, add the asparagus. You will use a similar process for 
                    seasoning. But we are not using any of the dried spices. So we'll add the oil, salt, pepper, 
                    garlic powder, and onion powder. Again tasting as we go.</li>
                <li>Now we will toss the asparagus onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum <em>(aluminium for my friends 
                    across the pond)</em>, and add a layer of Parmesan cheese over-top the asparagus. Either ground 
                    or shredded cheese is good for this. <em>Note: Unless you are only cooking one steak, refrain from 
                    throwing the asparagus into the oven quite yet. We'll add them in once we get to our second or third 
                    steak because they will only be cooking for twelve to fifteen minutes and you'll want them as warm as 
                    possible when you're plating your dish.</em></li>
                <li>Now we'll toss about a tablespoon or two's worth of cooking oil into our frying pan and get it warming
                     up over a medium heat.</li>
                <li>Now let's move to the steaks. As stated above, we are using freshly cracked salt and pepper to this 
                    dish. You'll want to add a pretty good layer of salt and pepper to each side of the steaks. Afterwards 
                    you'll want to crush your garlic, leaving it either in the peel or removing the peel. It works either way.
                <em>Note: It has been said by a fairly famous Chef, that approximately 30-50% of the seasonings on the surface 
                    of the steak will burn off once the steaks are introduced to the pan. So put more than you think you'll need. 
                    I promise it'll end up fine as long as you can still see the color of the steak underneath the seasoning.</em></li>
                <li>Once you have finished seasoning the steaks and your cooking oil has a nice sheen and is at it's smoking 
                    point, we'll add the steak to the pan. <em>Note: Lay the steak down away from you, this is to prevent as 
                    much oil splash as possible and reduce the chance of any pesky burns.</em></li>
                <li>The key to cooking these steaks is getting a nice dark brown crust on either side and then basting the 
                    steaks in butter to finish the process off.</li>
                <li>We will let the steak cook on this first side for about two minutes, once you have seared it well you 
                    will take some tongs and lift the steak up onto the fat cap present on the side, you will let this portion 
                    cook for about a minute to render the fat down and make it possible to eat without the fat being rock solid. 
                    This is a crucial step in the cooking process. </li>
                <li>After your fat has rendered down properly you will lay the steak on the other flat side to finish off our searing process.</li>
                <li>Once the steak has seared on this side for about a minute and a half you'll add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of 
                    butter on one side of the pan. </li>
                <li>Now lay your garlic and thyme on top of the steak. Push the steak to the side of the pan furthest from you and tip 
                    the pan towards you. Then, using a spoon scoop the melted butter over top of the steak. There are countless videos 
                    online detailing how to do this, and a visual aid really is the best way to learn this process, so I recommend looking 
                    a few videos up to get a good grasp on this skill.</li>
                <li>Baste the steak for about a minute to a minute and a half</li>
                <li>After the basting process is complete you'll want to lay it on either a clean cutting board or a plate to let it 
                    rest for at least five minutes.</li>
                <li>After removing it from the pan temp test the steak. Depending on what kind of cook you want the temps vary, 
                    but I always try to shoot for a medium rare-medium, which sits somewhere between 125-130 immediately after taking 
                    the steak off of heat.<em>Note: while resting the steak will continue cooking, so if it raises a few degrees do not be alarmed! 
                    This is normal and will not mess up anything, promise.</em></li>
                <li>Repeat this process (steps 15-23) for the rest of the steaks if you have any.</li>
                <li>Plating the dish is as simple as cutting the steak against the grain to your desired thickness, and adding it to a plate with 
                    your asparagus and potatoes. </li>
                <li>I use the optional Cajun seasoning just before step 25, tossing the cooked potatoes in a medium sized bowl to give them a bit of kick.</li>
                <li>And you're done! It was a long process, and no doubt your multi-tasking skills have been pressed to the absolute max but you did it. 
                    I hope you enjoy your meal and add it to your repertoire.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Just remember, steak is a dish that is NOT perfected in one go. Like anything getting the process down takes <em>practice</em>, and lots of it. My 
                first ten steaks were not perfect, and the next ten after that were just getting palatable. The times and temps you cook it at are entirely 
                dependent on your specific oven and pan you use, and the specifications given above may need some adjusting. But you'll get it, just keep 
                cooking til you get it right and add this fantastic dish to your repertoire. You <strong>won't</strong> regret it. </p>
            <p>Bye-bye!</p>
