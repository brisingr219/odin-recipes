        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This dish is one typically saved in my household for a special occasion. It does 
            not tend to be the kindest on your checkbook, but when completed it is <em>well</em> worth 
            the money you spend for the ingredients. It is a pan seared New York strip steak,
            served with oven baked asparagus, and air fried baby golden potatoes. I have found
            that learning how to make this dish properly really strengthens and builds on a lot 
            of the foundations and skills you learn when you're first starting out on your cooking
            journey, and developing new ones that will increase your skill. Please keep in mind this is 
            not a beginner's dish. It is going to be tough, it is going to test your pateience, but at
            the end of it all you will have grown as a cook! Enough yammering from me though. Let's get to it!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 New York Strip Steaks</li>
                <li>Two Bushels of Asparagus</li>
                <li>3 lbs of Baby Gold Yukon potatoes</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Fresh Thyme</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Cooking Oil</li>
                <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>Four Cloves of Garlic (per steak)</li>
                <li>Onion Powder</li>
                <li>Garlic Powder</li>
                <li>Dried Oregano</li>
                <li>Dried Basil</li>
                <li>Dried Rosemary</li>
                <li>Cajun Seasoning (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We'll start by preheating our oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. This is for the asparagus</li>
                <li>I use an air fryer for my potatoes. My settings are 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 
                    20 minutes, shaking the potatoes around at the 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let's also get out a pan to cook our steak in. The best kind is one big enough to fit the 
                    steak comfortably, while leaving about an inch and a half of room on all sides. This ensures 
                    you don't overcrowd the pan, and leave well enough room to baste the steaks later.</li>
                <li>Now let's prep the separate parts of the dish!</li>
                <li>For the asparagus you'll want to make sure you clean them and then break the ends off at 
                    their natural points. <em>Note: This can be done by grabbing either end of the asparagus 
                    and bending it until it breaks on it's own</em></li>
