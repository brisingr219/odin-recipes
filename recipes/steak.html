        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This dish is one typically saved in my household for a special occasion. It does 
            not tend to be the kindest on your checkbook, but when completed it is <em>well</em> worth 
            the money you spend for the ingredients. It is a pan seared New York strip steak,
            served with oven baked asparagus, and air fried baby golden potatoes. I have found
            that learning how to make this dish properly really strengthens and builds on a lot 
            of the foundations and skills you learn when you're first starting out on your cooking
            journey, and developing new ones that will increase your skill. Please keep in mind this is 
            not a beginner's dish. It is going to be tough, it is going to test your pateience, but at
            the end of it all you will have grown as a cook! Enough yammering from me though. Let's get to it!

                <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>Four Cloves of Garlic (per steak)</li>
                <li>Onion Powder</li>
                <li>Garlic Powder</li>
                <li>Dried Oregano</li>
                <li>Dried Basil</li>
                <li>Dried Rosemary</li>
                <li>Cajun Seasoning (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We'll start by preheating our oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. This is for the asparagus</li>
                <li>I use an air fryer for my potatoes. My settings are 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 
                    20 minutes, shaking the potatoes around at the 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let's also get out a pan to cook our steak in. The best kind is one big enough to fit the 
                    steak comfortably, while leaving about an inch and a half of room on all sides. This ensures 
                    you don't overcrowd the pan, and leave well enough room to baste the steaks later.</li>
                <li>Now let's prep the separate parts of the dish!</li>
                <li>For the asparagus you'll want to make sure you clean them and then break the ends off at 
                    their natural points. <em>Note: This can be done by grabbing either end of the asparagus 
                    and bending it until it breaks on it's own</em></li>
                <li>For the potatoes we are going to quarter them. They should be fairly small, and you'll cut 
                    them in half once and then in half once more.</li>
                <li>For the steaks you'll want to make sure that after they are defrosted you let them rest at 
                    room temp for at least 10-15 minutes before you apply any of the seasonings. This is a pretty 
                    good time to pat the steaks dry with a paper towel, removing any of the moisture build up from 
                    the defrosting process. Let's get to seasoning!
                    <em>Note: please observe SAFE food handling procedures, always wash your hands after touching raw 
                    meats and clean any surfaces you may place them on thoroughly to prevent any cross contamination.</em></li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl toss your quartered potatoes. Over top we'll add a thin layer of fresh 
                    cracked salt, a  thin layer of fresh cracked pepper, oregano, basil, rosemary, onion powder, and 
                    garlic powder.</li>
                <li>Now toss the potatoes kind of like a salad. This is to spread and mix the seasonings and oil so 
                    they cover all the potato sections evenly. Taste your mixture afterwards If you feel that there's 
                    ever not enough of a certain seasoning add more. However, you'll want to do this very carefully. 
                    Seasonings can be added easily, but overseasoning is a real possibility and can be tricky to undo.</li>
                <li>After your potatoes are seasoned we'll transfer them to the baskets of the air fryer. Mine has 
                    two 5 quart baskets so it makes cooking large batches at the same time fairly easy. <em>(Ninja for the win! lol)</em></li>
